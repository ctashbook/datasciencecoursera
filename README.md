My First Repository

This is my first attempt at creating and using a repository.  

Here are the steps that I will be attempting:
* Create the repository on GitHub
* Create a markdown document on my PC.  I'll use notepad and give the file the extension .md
* I'll run GitBash
* I'll create a local repository
* I'll change to that directory
* I'll copy the markdown file to that directory
* I'll add the file to the local reposity
* I'll commit the file to the local directory
* I'll link the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub 
* I'll push the markdown file to th eremote repository

It's not happening as easily as I thought.  This video echos my feelings at this point:
